In this talk I will discuss the torsion classes in the cohomology of
SL<sub>2</sub>(â„¤) as well as its variant with compact support.
As a consequence, we show how to deduce congruences of cuspidal forms with Eisenstein classes modulo small primes.
This generalizes the previous result on Ramanujan tau functions.
