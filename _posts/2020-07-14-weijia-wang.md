Let *Y*(*N*) be the modular curve of level *N* and *E*(*N*)
be the universal elliptic curve over *Y*(*N*).
Beilinson (1986) defined the Eisenstein symbol in the motivic cohomology of
*E*<sub>*k*</sub>(*N*) and the work of Deninger-Scholl (1989) shows the
Petersson inner product of its regulator gives us special *L*-values.
In this talk I will present how to relate the modular regulator with
*L*-value of quasi-modular forms by using Lanphier's formula and Rogers-Zudilin method.
