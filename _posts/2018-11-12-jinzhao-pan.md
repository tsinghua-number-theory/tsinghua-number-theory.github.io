Let *E* be a CM elliptic curve defined over rational numbers with analytic rank one. The full BSD conjecture for *E* at a good supersingular prime is proved by Kobayashi, based on previous works by Gross-Zagier, Rubin, Kolyvagin, Perrin-Riou, et al. In this second talk some more technical details will be concerned.
