In his 1973 paper, Shimura established a lifting from half-integral
weight modular forms to integral weight modular forms. After that,
Waldspurger studied this in the framework of automorphic
representations and classified the automorphic discrete spectrum of
the metaplectic group Mp(2), which is a nonlinear double cover of
SL(2), in terms of that of PGL(2). We discuss a generalization of his
classification to the metaplectic group Mp(4) of rank 2. This is joint
work with Wee Teck Gan.
