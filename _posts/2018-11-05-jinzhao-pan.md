Let *E* be a CM elliptic curve defined over rational numbers with analytic rank one. The full BSD conjecture for *E* at a good supersingular prime is proved by Kobayashi, based on previous works by Gross-Zagier, Rubin, Kolyvagin, Perrin-Riou, et al. In the first talk I'll briefly introduce these works and some key ingredients in them, and the comparison to my work at a potentially supersingular prime joint with Ye Tian.
