 It was known to Euler that ζ(2*k*) is a rational multiple of π<sup>2<i>k</i></sup>, where ζ is the Euler-Riemann zeta function,
 and *k* is a positive integer. Deligne conjectured that similar results hold for motives over number fields,
 and automorphic analogue of Deligne's conjecture was also expected.
 I will explain the automorphic conjecture, as well as some recent progresses on it.
 The Archimedean theory of cohomological representations and cohomological test vectors
 will also be explained, as they play a key role in the proof.
