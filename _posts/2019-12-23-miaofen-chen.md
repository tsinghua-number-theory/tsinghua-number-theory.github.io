Rapoport and Zink introduce the *p*-adic period domain (also called the admissible locus)
inside the rigid analytic *p*-adic flag varieties. Over the admissible locus,
there exists a universal crystalline ℚ<sub><i>p</i></sub>-local system which
interpolates a family of
crystalline representations. The weakly admissible locus is an approximation of
the admissible locus in the sense that these two spaces have the same classical points.
The Fargues-Rapoport conjecture for basic local Shimura datum gives a group theoretic
characterization when the admissible locus and the weakly admissible locus coincide.
In this talk, we will give a similar characterization for non-basic local Shimura datum.
We will also discuss the question about where lives the weakly admissible points outside
the admissible locus in general.
