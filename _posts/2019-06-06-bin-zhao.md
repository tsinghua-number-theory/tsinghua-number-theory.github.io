In this talk, I will first explain the motivation to study the slopes of modular forms.
It has an intimate relation with the geometry of eigencurves.
I will mention two conjectures on the geometry of eigencurves:
the halo conjecture concerning the boundary behavior, and the ghost conjecture concerning the central behavior.
I will then explain some known results towards these conjectures. The former one is a joint work with Rufei Ren,
which generalizes a previous work of Ruochuan Liu, Daqing Wan and Liang Xiao.
The latter one is a joint work in progress with Ruochuan Liu, Nha Truong and Liang Xiao.
