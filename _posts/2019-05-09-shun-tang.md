As an overview of Arakelov geometry, we first introduce several Riemann-Roch problems for arithmetic
<i>K</i><sub>0</sub>-groups. They deduce various interesting structural and quantitative statements
which relate arithmetical invariants of algebraic varieties to special values of logarithmic derivatives of *L*-functions.
Then we turn to higher arithmetic *K*-theory,  we establish its covariant functoriality by using analytic torsion for cubes
of hermitian vector bundles.
