Let *E* be a CM number field and *p* be a prime unramified in *E*.
In this talk, we explain a level-raising result at *p* for regular algebraic conjugate self-dual
cuspidal automorphic representations of GL<sub><i>n</i></sub>(<b>A</b><sub><i>E</i></sub>).
This generalizes previously known results of Jack Thorne.
