In this talk, I will first introduce the thesis of Akshay Venkatesh on Beyond Endoscopy
for Sym<sup>2</sup> *L*-functions on GL<sub>2</sub> over ℚ or a totally real field.
The idea follows a suggestion of Peter Sarnak on using the Kuznetsov relative trace formula
instead of the Arthur-Selberg trace formula for the Beyond Endoscopy problem.
I will then discuss how to generalize Venkatesh's work from totally real to
arbitrary number fields. The main supplement is an integral formula for the
Fourier transform of Bessel functions over ℂ.
