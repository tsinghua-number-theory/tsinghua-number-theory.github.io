I will explain a joint work with Xinwen Zhu on constructing algebraic cycles
on special fibers of Shimura varieties using geometric Satake theory.
The talk will focus on explaining the key construction which upgrades
the geometric Satake theory to a functor that relates the category
of coherent sheaves on the stack [*G*Ïƒ / *G*] to the category of sheaves
on local Shtukas with cohomological correspondences as morphisms.
