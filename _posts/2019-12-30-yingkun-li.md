The values of the modular *j*-invariant at CM points are called
singular moduli. They have been known to be algebraic integers
since the time of Kronecker and Weber. Recently,
Bilu-Habegger-Kühne showed that these are not units.
In this talk, we will apply the results of
Gross-Zagier, Gross-Kohnen-Zagier and their generalizations to give a
short proof of this result.
