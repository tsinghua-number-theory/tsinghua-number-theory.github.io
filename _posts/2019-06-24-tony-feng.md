In 1966 Artin and Tate constructed a canonical pairing on the Brauer group of a surface over a finite field,
and conjectured it to be alternating. This duality has analogous incarnations across arithmetic and topology,
namely the Cassels-Tate pairing for a Jacobian variety, and the linking form on a 5-manifold.
I will explain a proof of the conjecture, which is based on a surprising connection to Steenrod operations.
