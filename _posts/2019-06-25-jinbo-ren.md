A large family of classical problems in number theory such as:

a) Finding rational solutions of the so-called trigonometric Diophantine equation
*F*(cos 2π<i>x</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>, sin 2π<i>x</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>)=0, where *F* is an irreducible
multivariate polynomial with rational coefficients;

b) Determining all λ∈ℂ such that (2, (2(2-λ))<sup>1/2</sup>) and
(3, (6(3-λ))<sup>1/2</sup>) are both torsion points of the elliptic curve *y*<sup>2</sup>=*x*(*x*-1)(*x*-λ);

can be regarded as special cases of the Zilber-Pink conjecture in Diophantine geometry.
In this talk, I will explain how we use tools from mathematical logic to attack this conjecture.
In particular, I will present a series partial results toward the Zilber-Pink conjecture,
including those proved by Christopher Daw and myself.

This talk is an expanded version of the one I gave during ICCM.
