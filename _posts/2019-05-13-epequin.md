Let 𝔽<sub><i>q</i></sub> be a finite field with <i>q</i> elements and odd characteristic. A pair
(<i>G</i>, <i>G</i>′) of mutually centralized reductive subgroups of Sp<sub>2<i>n</i></sub>(𝔽<sub><i>q</i></sub>) is called
a *reductive dual pair*. By means of the Weil representation of Sp<sub>2<i>n</i></sub>(𝔽<sub><i>q</i></sub>),
Roger Howe introduced a correspondence Θ: ℛ(<i>G</i>) → ℛ(<i>G</i>′) between the
category of complex representations of these subgroups. Here we discuss
how this correspondence relates the *Harish-Chandra series* of <i>G</i> to those
of <i>G</i>′. If time allows, we will discuss how this correspondance can be
expressed as a correspondance between unipotent Harish-Chandra series.
