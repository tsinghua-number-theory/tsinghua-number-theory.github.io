In the first part of my talk, I shall review some definitions of Scholze's pro-etale site and his proof of de Rham comparison theorem for rigid analytic spaces. Then, I shall concentrate in crystalline comparison theorems: I will introduce the so-called pro-etale crystalline topos, and sketch the proof of a version of crystalline comparison theorem, generalizing a previous result of Faltings. This part is based on a joint work with Yichao Tian.
