Twenty years ago Lusztig introduced the semi-canonical basis for the enveloping algebra *U*(ùñì),
where ùñì is a maximal unipotent sub-Lie algebra of some simple Lie algebra of type *A*, *D*, *E*. Later on *B*.
Leclerc found a counter-example to some conjecture of Bernstein-Zelevinsky and related it to the
difference between dual canonical basis and dual semi-canonical basis.
He further introduced a condition (open orbit conjecture of Geiss-Leclerc-Schoer)
under which dual canonical basis and dual semi-canonical basis coincide.
In this talk we explain in detail the above relations and show a relation between the two bases above through micro-local analysis.
