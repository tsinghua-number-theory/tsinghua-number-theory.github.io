In his seminal paper in 2001, Henri Darmon came up with a systematic construction
of *p*-adic points, viz. Stark-Heegner points, on elliptic curves over the rationals.
In this talk, I will report on the construction of local (*p*-adic) cohomology classes
in the Harris-Soudry-Taylor representation associated to a Bianchi cusp form,
building on the ideas of Henri Darmon and Rotger-Seveso.
These local cohomology classes are conjecturally the restriction of global cohomology classes
in an appropriate Bloch-Kato Selmer group and have consequences towards
the Bloch-Kato-Beilinson conjecture as well as Gross-Zagier type results.
This is based on a joint work with Chris Williams (University of Warwick).
