A theorem of Deligne says that compatible systems of
*l*-adic sheaves on a smooth curve over a finite field
are compatible along the boundary. I will present an extension of Deligne's
theorem to schemes of finite type over the ring of integers of a local field.
This has applications to the *l*-independence of the *l*-adic cohomology of
varieties over Henselian valuation fields, possibly of higher rank.
This is joint work with Qing Lu.
