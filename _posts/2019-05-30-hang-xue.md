I will explain what linear models are and their relation with automorphic forms.
I will explain how to relate the existence of linear models to the local constants.
This extends a classical result of Saito-Tunnell. I gave a talk last year here on the implication in one direction,
I will explain my recent idea on the implication in the other direction.
