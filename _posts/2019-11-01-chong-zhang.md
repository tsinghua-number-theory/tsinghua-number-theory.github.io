Regular supercuspidal representations are recently introduced by Kaletha,
which are a subclass of tame supercuspidal representations.
This new construction has many applications in the representation theory of
reductive *p*-adic groups. In this talk, I will briefly review basic definition
and properties of regular supercuspidal representations.
I will also discuss the distinction problem for these representations,
and also its relation with the local theta correspondence.
