Let *V* be a semi-stable non-crystalline *p*-adic Galois representation. By *p*-adic Hodge theory, one can associate to *V* the so-called Fontaine-Mazur *L*-invariants, which are invisible in the classical local Langlands correspondence. A task in *p*-adic Langlands program is to understand their counterpart on the automorphic side. In this talk, we will first review some of Breuil's initial work on *p*-adic Langlands program and *L*-invariants in GL<sub>2</sub>(â„š<sub><i>p</i></sub>)-case, and then report some recent progress (joint with Breuil) on higher *L*-invariants.
