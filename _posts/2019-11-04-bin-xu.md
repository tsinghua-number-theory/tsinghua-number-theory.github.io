Automorphic descent, developed by Ginzburg-Rallis-Soudry,
is a method which constructs concrete automorphic representations of classical groups,
and has various applications in the study of automorphic representations.
In this talk, we will introduce an automorphic descent construction for symplectic groups,
and discuss its applications to global Gan-Gross-Prasad problem
and quadratic twists of *L*-functions.  This is a joint work with Baiying Liu.
