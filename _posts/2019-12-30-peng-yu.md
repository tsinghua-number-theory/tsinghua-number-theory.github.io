In 1985, Gross and Zagier discovered a beautiful factorization formula for
the norm of difference of singular moduli.
This has inspired a lot of interesting work, one of which is the study of CM values
of automorphic Green functions on orthogonal or unitary Shimura varieties.
Now we generalize the definition of CM cycles beyond the 'small' and 'big' CM cycles
and give a uniform formula in general using the idea of regularized theta lifts.
Finally, as an application, we are able to give an explicit factorization formula
for the norm of λ(½(*d*₁+*d*₁<sup>½</sup>)) - λ(½(*d*₂+*d*₂<sup>½</sup>))
with λ being the modular lambda invariant under the condition (*d*₁, *d*₂) = 1.
The key observation is that λ(*z*₁) - λ(*z*₂)
is a Borcherds product on *X*(2) × *X*(2).
