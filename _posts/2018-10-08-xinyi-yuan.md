In this talk, I will introduce a formula expressing the modular height of a quaternionic Shimura curve over a totally real field in terms of the logarithmic derivative at 2 of the Dedekind zeta function of the totally real field. The proof of the formula is inspired by the previous work of Yuan-Zhang-Zhang on the Gross-Zagier formula.
