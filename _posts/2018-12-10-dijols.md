The Generalized Injectivity Conjecture of Casselman-Shahidi states that the unique irreducible generic subquotient of a (generic) standard module is necessarily a subrepresentation. It is related to *L*-functions, as studied by Shahidi, hence has some number-theoretical flavor, although our technics lie in the fields of representations of reductive groups over local fields. It was proven for classical groups (SO(2*n*+1), Sp(2*n*), SO(2*n*)) by M. Hanzer in 2010. In this talk, I will first explain our interest in this conjecture, and describe its main ingredients. I will further present our proof (under some restrictions) which uses techniques more amenable to prove this conjecture for all quasi-split groups.
