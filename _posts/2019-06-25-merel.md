The torsion primes for elliptic curves over algebraic number fields of degree *d* are bounded,
according to the best current knowledge, exponentially in *d*.
A disappointing result as polynomial bounds are expected. We will discuss what can be expected,
and see how the use of the derived modular group can help clarify the limits of the current methods.
