We will survey cuspidality criterions for several cases of functoriality lifts for automorphic forms for
GL(*N*). Here is one important case we will sketch the proof: Let
π, π′ be cuspidal automorphic representations for GL(2), GL(3), and Π = π ⊠ π′ the Kim-Shahidi lift from
GL(2) × GL(3) to GL(6). Then Π is cuspidal unless two exceptional cases occur.
In particular, a modular form of Galois type which is associated to an odd icosahedral Galois representation must be cuspidal.
