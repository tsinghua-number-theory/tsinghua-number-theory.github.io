A cuspidal automorphic representations of GL(3) over a number field, submitted to mild extra assumptions,
is determined by the quadratic twists of its central *L*-values. Beyond the result itself,
its proof is an archetypical argument in the world of multiple Dirichlet series,
and therefore a perfect excuse to introduce these objects in this talk.
