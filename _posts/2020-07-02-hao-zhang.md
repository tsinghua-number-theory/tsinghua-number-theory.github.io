A classical result of Eichler, Shimura and Manin asserts that the map that
assigns to a cusp form *f* its period polynomial *r<sub>f</sub>* is a Hecke equivariant map.
We propose a generalization of this result to a setting where *r<sub>f</sub>*
is replaced by a family of rational function of *N* variables equipped with the action of
GL<sub>*N*</sub>(ℤ). For this purpose, we develop a theory of Hecke operators for the
elliptic cocycle recently introduced by Charollois.
In particular, when f is an eigenform, the corresponding rational function is also an
eigenvector respect to Hecke operator for GL<sub>*N*</sub>. Finally,
we give some examples for Eisenstein series and the Ramanujan Delta function.
