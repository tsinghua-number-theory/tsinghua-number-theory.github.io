This talk is an introduction to some well-known theorems in anabelian geometry.
We will focus on Uchida's theorem on function fields,
and give a modern proof, i.e. an algorithm which reconstructs the function field
group-theoretically via the Galois group of some solvably closed Galois extension.
This is the so-called mono-anabelian approach.
Time permitting, I will explain the absolute anabelian theorem for
hyperbolic curves of strictly Belyi type.
