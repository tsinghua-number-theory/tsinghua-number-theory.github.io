In this talk, we will explain Andreatta-Iovita's work on the *p*-adic iteration of Gauss-Manin connections
in the space of nearly overconvergent elliptic modular forms (of unbounded order) and its application
to the construction of triple product *p*-adic *L*-functions.
If time permits, we will explain how to generalize these results to rational Shimura curves.
