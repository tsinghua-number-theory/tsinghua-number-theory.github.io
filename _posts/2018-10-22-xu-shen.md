In his 1970 ICM report, Grothendieck asked the question to describe the *p*-adic analogues of Griffiths period domains. In this talk, we will review some constructions for these *p*-adic period domains, following recent developments in *p*-adic Hodge theory. We will then explain some ideas in a proof of the Fargues-Rapoport conjecture about the structure of certain *p*-adic period domains. This is joint work with Miaofen Chen and Laurent Fargues.
