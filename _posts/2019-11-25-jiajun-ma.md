Descent is the "inverse" of Langlands functorial lift.
The descent of symplectic supercuspidal representations of
GL(2*n*) to SO(2*n*+1) over *p*-adic fields was established by Dihua Jiang,
Chufeng Nien and Yujun Qin. In this talk, I will first give an explicit description
of the local descent in the depth zero case.
Then I will discuss a conjectural description in the general case.
This is an ongoing joint work with Dongwen Liu, Chufeng Nien and Zhicheng Wang.
