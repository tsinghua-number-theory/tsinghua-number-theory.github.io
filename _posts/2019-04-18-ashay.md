Let *E* be an elliptic curve over the rationals with conductor *N*.
A conjecture due to Perrin-Riou describes a rank one aspect of the associated *p*-adic Beilinson-Kato elements for a prime *p*.
In the case (*p*,*2N*)=1, we plan to describe setup and strategy in our result towards the conjecture (joint with Christopher Skinner and Ye Tian).
