Let *K* be a finite extension of ℚ<sub><i>p</i></sub>.
A useful tool to study *p*-adic representations of
*G*<sub><i>K</i></sub> = Gal(*K̅*/*K*)
is the theory of cyclotomic (φ,Γ)-modules of Fontaine,
which relies on a characteristic 0 lift of the field of norms of the cyclotomic extension.
In this talk, we will be interested in the following question:
by what kind of Galois extensions *K*<sub>∞</sub>/*K* can we replace the cyclotomic extension
in order to build a (φ,Γ)-modules theory?
We will show that under a certain additional assumption,
such an extension is generated by the torsion points of a relative Lubin-Tate group
and that the power series giving the action of the Galois group of *K*<sub>∞</sub>/*K*
are twists of semi-conjugates of endomorphisms of the same relative Lubin-Tate group.
