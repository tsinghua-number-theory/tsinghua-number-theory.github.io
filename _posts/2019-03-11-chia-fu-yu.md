I will describe the current status on the geometry of Drinfeld moduli schemes we know. Main part of this talk will explain the construction of the arithmetic Satake compactification, and the geometry of compactified Drinfeld period domain over finite fields due to Pink and Schieder.
We also plan to explain local and global properties of the strafification of reduction modulo *v* of a Drinfeld moduli scheme. This is joint work with Urs Hartl.
