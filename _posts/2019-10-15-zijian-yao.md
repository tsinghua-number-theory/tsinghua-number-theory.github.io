A major goal of *p*-adic Hodge theory is to relate arithmetic structures
coming from various cohomologies of *p*-adic varieties.
Such comparisons are usually achieved by constructing intermediate cohomology theories.
A recent successful theory, namely the *A*<sub>inf</sub>-cohomology,
has been invented by Bhatt-Morrow-Scholze, originally via perfectoid spaces.
In this talk, I will describe a simpler approach to prove the comparison
between *A*<sub>inf</sub>-cohomology and absolute crystalline cohomology,
using the de Rham comparison and flat descent of cotangent complexes.
